# Debian-Server-Sec

### **Automated installation of security components for standard Linux Debian distribution.**

Imagine that your web server failed for reason you know. It is good that you know the failure 
so you can correct it. The problem is downtime. To avoid two weeks of configuring your server 
over again. Fixing typos and other bugs you make on the way. You need automation. This project
is to address that and extend security strategy. Yes there are vast number of pages written on
issues of configuration (the old methods and new methods proponents) and you have to experiment
and select option that works. With security there is basic security information and more 
extensive that is overwhelming for most web administrators or server administrators. 
Security of server is not fixed it is evolving with all progress in software and hardware. 
Secure system of today my not be secure tomorrow. 


Linux have multiple distributions that all address specific tasks. In this project I will address:

1. Automated post installation and configuration.
2. Network, web and security components configuration.
3. Recovery planing in case of hardware, software or security failure.
4. Preparing for fastest recovery minimising downtime.
5. Monitoring for security related activity.
6. Learning what else need to be done.

As starting point I elected Debian 11.5.
